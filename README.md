# Letters-for-T

My dearest Bae, ❤️

I miss you more than words can say. Lately, I’ve realized that I can’t hold on the way I wanted to, so I have to let you go… softly, like watching a sunset and thinking quietly, “It’s beautiful, isn’t it?” 🌅

I hope you always take care of yourself and stay strong, even on the days that feel hard. You deserve so much happiness, peace, and love in your life. If someday you meet someone new, I truly hope he treats you with the kindness, respect, and care that you deserve. I hope he makes you laugh, supports your dreams, and brings you the kind of happiness that lights up your soul.

Even though I have to step back, please know that I will always wish the very best for you—from the bottom of my heart. May your days be filled with warmth, love, and smiles, because you are someone truly special. 💛

Take care, always.
